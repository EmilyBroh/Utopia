Conclusion
Motivation:
Growing up in the United States, I was often led to believe that the United States was one of the best nations in the world.  I believe public schooling often teaches American children to focus on the positives of the United States, without fully acknowledging the shortcomings of our country or the ways in which other nations surpass us.  I wanted to illustrate the different strengths and weaknesses of major countries all over the world, while highlighting potential interesting correlations and giving a numeric weighted score to each country, based on physiological, psychological, and emotional needs and how those needs are addressed by each governing body.


Questions:
Which countries fail to meet its citizens basic needs, and what countries best meet them?
Which countries rank as the safest and most unsafe in comparison to one another?
How much does GDP/GNI really affect major metrics, such as crime, economic inequality, etc.
Is there a correlation between reported happiness levels and longer levels of schooling? What about happiness and access to the internet?


Problems and Hurdles

Despite a lot of these metrics being obtained by the same organizations, many of them did not have universalized country names. For example, The United Kingdom sometimes showed up as Great Britain, or the UK.  To combat this, I installed and imported "country_converter". This didn't fix all the issues, but it did limit how many countries I was inadvertently losing due to attempting to merge data frames with non-matching names.

The datasets I was able to obtain did not have a large number of overlapping years. That said, I did my best to filter each dataset down to the most recent years with sufficient measurements. All datasets come from a nine year period of time (2016 - 2025).


Technologies Used
Python / Pandas - for exploration, normalizing and aggregation of the dataset
Tableau - for creating interactive dashboard
Figma - for introduction of Project
Canva - for introduction of Project
Git - for version control
