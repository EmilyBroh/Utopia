A detailed analysis and custom weighted measurement system to calculate the world's most utopian societies.
Emily Broh’s Utopian Society Metrics
This system is based strongly on Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, with flexibility given regarding the interpretation of some metrics that don’t decisively fall into one of the five categories.  The categories* are labeled as follows:

*For a comprehensive overview of the measurements and datasets used in each category, please see the detailed breakdown document.

A: Basic Needs 
•	This includes measurements such as sanitization practices, access to clean water, etc.
B: Safety and Security
•	This includes measurements such as gross national income, homicide rates, life expectancy, vaccination rates, etc.
C: Social Relationships and Family
•	This includes measurements such as loneliness, closeness to family, and reported friendships.
D: Prestige and Feeling of Accomplishment
•	This includes measurements such as the number of researchers per capita, years of schooling per person, etc.
E: Contentment, Emphasis on Culture and Humanities
•	This includes measurements such as self-reported levels of happiness, 
self-reported levels of trust in fellow citizens, and overall life satisfaction rates.




Further Categories for Calculation Purposes
F. Essentials 
•	This is a combination of categories A and B, which represents essential aspects of daily life in which a high score is necessary for basic quality of life.
G. Utopian Ideals
•	This is a combination of categories D and E, which represents aspects in which high ratings would universally be considered ideal but are not necessary to daily survival.

Weighted Measurements
In the absence of scoring modifiers, the categories will be weighted as follows:
•	Category A: 5
•	Category B: 4
•	Category C: 3
•	Category D: 2
•	Category E: 1

Scoring Modifiers
•	If a country has a cumulative percentile score of 80% or higher in the essentials category (A and B), then category D is given 10% greater weight in the final calculation, and category E is given 5% greater weight.
•	ALT IDEA: If a country has a cumulative percentile score of 80% or higher in the essentials category (A and B), then category D is given 0.5 greater weight in the final calculation, and category E is given 0.25 greater weight. This would equate to D being weighted as 2.5 as opposed to 2, and E being weighted 1.25 as opposed to 1.
•	If a country cumulatively ranks at or above the 80th percentile in categories A, B, and C, then in addition to the modifiers given in the essentials category, the country will also be given a 10% bonus in category C.
•	If a country ranks at or above the 80th percentile for category A, but not category B, no extra weight is given to categories D and E.
•	If a country ranks at or above the 80th percentile in category B, but not category A, this will detract from the country’s scores for categories D and E at a rate of -10% for D, and -5% for E. The logic behind this is that when a country is not able to cover the basic needs of an individual, then their Utopian Ideals category is not something universally applicable or accessible to all citizens.
